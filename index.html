<p class="para1">Friendship is a strong bond between two people. Friends are those people whom we are not connected by blood, but by heart. </p>
<aside> 
<p>Besides, having a loving and caring family, we need good friends to be by our side throughtout all the ups and downs in our life. We make friends at different stages of our life. If people are lucky enough to find a good friend for lifetime, they are counted as blessed. Also, having a good conversation with your friend can uplift your mood. However, making friends has a big impact in our life. We start imitating their behavior and habits unconsciously. If people learn any constructive behavior, then that is great. But, if they follow poor behavior and unpleasant things from them then that friendship is up to no good for them. Though, friendship is a blessing but people who are not mentally stable such as having <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder">ADHD</abbr> finds it hard to maintain a friendship. Also, losing a good friend takes a toll on us. Therefore, we should always be very conscious while choosing a friend. <br><br>

    Here is a quoted data about friendship from Wikipedia website: </p>
<blockquote cite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship >"A World Happiness Database study found that people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness."</blockquote>
